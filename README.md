# Installation

For installation, just download the zip of this library. After unpacking, run the "initialize.bat" and follow the steps. Afterwards, run the "build.cmd".

Keep in mind that in the current state, powershell is required and should be included in the path variables. For Windows 10 users this should be the default case.
