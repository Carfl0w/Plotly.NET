# Installation

Plotly.NET will be available as 2.0.0 version of its predecessor FSharp.Plotly. The feature roadmap can be seen [here](https://github.com/plotly/Plotly.NET/issues/43). Contributions are very welcome!

Old packages up until version 1.2.2 can be accessed via the old package name *FSharp.Plotly* [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Plotly/)

### For applications and libraries

A preview version of Plotly.NET 2.0.0 is available on nuget to plug into your favorite package manager:

 - dotnet CLI

```shell
dotnet add package Plotly.NET --version 2.0.0-alpha5
```

 - paket CLI

```shell
paket add Plotly.NET --version 2.0.0-beta1
```

 - package manager

```shell
Install-Package Plotly.NET -Version 2.0.0-beta1
```

Or add the package reference directly to your `.*proj` file:

```
<PackageReference Include="Plotly.NET" Version="2.0.0-beta1" />
```

### For scripting

You can include the package via an inline package reference:

```
#r "nuget: Plotly.NET, 2.0.0-beta1"
```

### For dotnet interactive notebooks

You can use the same inline package reference as in script, but as an additional goodie, 
the interactive extensions for dotnet interactive have you covered for seamless chart rendering:

```
#r "nuget: Plotly.NET, 2.0.0-beta1"
#r "nuget: Plotly.NET.Interactive, 2.0.0-beta1"
```
