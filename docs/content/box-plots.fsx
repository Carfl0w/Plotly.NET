# FSharp.Plotly: BoxPlot Charts

*Summary:* This example shows how to create boxplot charts in F#.

A box plot or boxplot is a convenient way of graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. 
Box plots may also have lines extending vertically from the boxes (whiskers) indicating variability outside the upper
and lower quartiles, hence the terms box-and-whisker plot and box-and-whisker diagram. 
Outliers may be plotted as individual points.
